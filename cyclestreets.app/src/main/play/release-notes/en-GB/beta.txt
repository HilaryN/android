When you've planned a route you can tap on the screen to add more waypoints.  This will show the new alternative route in a slightly different colour.
If you change your mind, pressing the back button will remove the waypoints you have added, one at a time.
Once you are happy with the new route, tap the button at the top of the screen to accept it.

If you've planned a route and want to modify it, you can long-press the route and take the option to Add / Remove waypoints.
This will take you back to the Journey Planner, keeping the waypoints from the route, and allowing to remove any or add more.

When planning a journey, tapping on any waypoint allows you to remove it (rather than having to tap the back button and remove subsequent waypoints) or change its sequence.

Intermediate waymarks are now numbered on the screen.

LiveRide replans are no longer saved in your list of saved routes.

When a route is replanned in LiveRide, the plan for the current route (fastest/balanced etc) is used, rather than the one in your preferences.

Circular leisure routes! Tap your starting waypoint and then choose a duration or distance.
You can optionally choose to specify POIs to include on the circular route.

Various minor bug fixes.
